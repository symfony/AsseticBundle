You need increase minimal supporting twig version inside composer for this changes

@Koc thanks for the notice.

We still have a few failures there:

- some unexpected calls to mocks, which should be debugged
- some remaining Twig deprecations, which means your commit is incomplete

That second deprecation notice (`Passing a string as the $source argument of Twig_Environment::tokenize() is deprecated since version 1.27. Pass a Twig_Source instance instead.`) must be fixed in Assetic itself. There is already a PR for that one: https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/pull/819

@stof all what was possible fixed, but [this one](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/pull/820) must go first.

I have used dev-master for assetic to see the tests, after it is tagged I think this will be ready to merge.

@stof would be great if you could tag new versions of both assetic and assetic-bundle, when this one is merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2016-11-08T11:16:51Z

@hvt you mean tag assetic, then merge this one with a version >=1.3.3 and tag this, right?

@stof I have prepared release notes you can use: https://github.com/kubawerlos/assetic/releases/tag/v1.3.3

by hvt at 2016-11-08T11:27:19Z

@kubawerlos that's what I mean yes :+1:

I also just stumbled upon the `Twig_Node::getLine` and `Twig_TokenStream::getFilename` deprecations. Will this PR be merged soon?

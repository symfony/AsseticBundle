any chances this is going to be merged?

I would remove the call entirely instead.

Ok for me! I just did it the same way as it was done on the other bundles (framework, monolog, etc)

@stof as you asked I've removed the usage of the method completely!

Backwards compatibility?
```php
if (PHP_VERSION_ID < 70000) {
        $this->addClassesToCompile(array(
            'Symfony\\Bundle\\AsseticBundle\\DefaultValueSupplier',
            'Symfony\\Bundle\\AsseticBundle\\Factory\\AssetFactory',
            /* This will introduce hard dependency on Twig
            'Assetic\\Extension\\Twig\\AsseticExtension',
            'Assetic\\Extension\\Twig\\ValueContainer',
            'Symfony\\Bundle\\AsseticBundle\\Twig\\AsseticExtension',
            */
        ));
}
```

@nisanov that was what I had in mind (see first commit). @stof what is the reason to remove this whole block? And is it indeed not a bc break?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@acrobat BC is not an issue as it was always only a performance improvement. Removing the entire block may degrade performance on old PHP versions, but not change any behavior. And seriously, for 2 classes it's likely only occasionally measurable on PHP5 versions before OpCache became standard in PHP 5.5.

Alright! The PR is ready for merge!

Is there any progress on this issue?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by XWB at 2017-06-22T10:19:39Z

Ping @stof ? :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by XWB at 2017-06-30T10:56:59Z

Ping @fabpot perhaps? :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry adding to this @fabpot & @stof , but it would be great if assetic at least fix deprecations because some of my projects are 99% ready to upgrade to symfony 4, 1% remaining being Assetic.
I would like to stop using assetic but the projects are to big to do it and I will probably use webpack for new projects.
